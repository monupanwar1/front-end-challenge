## 🛠️ Implementation Steps
### **A) Login Flow**
1. Create a **login page** with validation.  
2. Send API request → `POST /auth/login`.  
3. Store **session details securely**.  

### **B) Dashboard Flow**
1. Show **statistics & insights** for commodities.  
2. Restrict access using **role-based gating**.  

### **C) Product Management**
1. Fetch product data → `GET /products`.  
2. Allow **adding/editing** via forms (`POST/PUT /products`).  

### **D) UI Enhancements**
1. Implement **Light/Dark Mode toggle** with localStorage.  
2. **Role-based UI restrictions** for platform features.

## 🔥 Bonus Challenge: Role-Based Menu Restriction
